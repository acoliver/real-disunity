# Configured post and output

`PostChain<F: StageFactory>` is a retained, **linear** post/output service. It is not a general render graph and does not submit commands or acquire surfaces.

- `FrameConfig` specifies the scene extent, color format and sample count. `FrameTargets` retains the resolved color texture and optional multisample texture. Use `scene()` and `resolve()` together for the scene pass; subsequent stages always bind `resolved()`.
- `Resources::new` allocates opaque, explicitly sized caller-authored buffers. Move these into the chain for exposure/history/config ownership. Neither resize nor reconfiguration clears or reallocates them. The provider defines their binding layouts and initialization bytes; the service does not infer or reinterpret an exposure ABI.
- `StageFactory::build` creates bind groups and returns an ordered `StageSet`. It is called on construction, resize and reconfiguration, **not** once per frame. Move sized textures and buffers into `StageSet::resources`; pipeline and sampler handles can remain in the factory. Failed resize/reconfiguration leaves the previous target set and schedule intact.
- `Stage` describes a clear, buffer copy, compute dispatch or fullscreen draw. Bind groups retain the provider's explicit layouts and ascending group order. An optional stage can be absent or `enabled: false`. The provider is responsible for supplying a valid bypass/input when an effect is disabled. The service validates one final enabled output and bounded compute dispatches before accepting a schedule.
- `encode` executes the configured order against a supplied surface or offscreen output view. It does not choose exposure, bloom, tone curves, LUTs, adaptation rules or antialiasing. Providers must declare those stages and dependencies explicitly.
- `CopyOutput` is the built-in **no-effects** factory: nearest texel copy, including scaling and destination attachment transfer/channel encoding. It does not introduce a display look.
- `color_texture` allocates common intermediate/output textures. `Readback` retains bounded staging storage, verifies the source contract, strips padding and returns native bytes (RGBA/BGRA/HDR are not silently converted). Mapping has a shared 30-second deadline and unmaps on returned errors.

Minimal copy-only presentation:

```rust,ignore
let mut output = PostChain::new(
    device,
    FrameConfig::new([width, height], scene_format, samples),
    Resources::default(),
    CopyOutput::new(device, surface_format),
)?;
// Render using output.targets().scene() and output.targets().resolve().
output.encode(encoder, surface_view);
output.resize(device, [new_width, new_height])?;
```

For an authored effect, implement `StageFactory`; compile custom shaders with `fullscreen_pipeline` / `compute_pipeline` and construct explicit bind groups in `build`. For example, return histogram clear, histogram dispatch, exposure dispatch, bloom draws, then an output draw. A diagnostic exposure override is an in-order `CopyBuffer` stage, not a queue write racing the compute schedule. Updating per-frame uniforms remains a caller responsibility, before submission. An output format change requires a correspondingly configured factory/pipeline; device/surface lifecycle and capture publication remain host responsibilities.

The required GPU tests exercise exact copy, HDR/MSAA resolve, nonaligned readback, optional output changes, disabled-stage preservation, history across resize/reconfiguration and typed invalid configurations. They use native PRIMARY backends by default and honor `WGPU_BACKEND`; adapter absence fails rather than skips.

## Ordered host captures

For a capture inside an existing frame encoder, construct `Readback` with the **actual source format**, extent, sample count 1, and an explicit byte ceiling. Call `encode(encoder, source)` at the capture point, submit that encoder, then call `read_encoded(device, submission)`; `None` waits for all submitted work. `read(device, queue, source)` remains the convenience copy/submit/read path. A mutable borrow prevents overlapping maps through this owner. The caller must use the creating device and submit encoded copies before reading.

Supported native formats are RGBA8/BGRA8 linear and sRGB, RGBA16Float, R32Float and RGBA32Float. Wrong-format, multisampled, array, non-D2, wrong-size and missing-COPY_SRC sources are rejected before copy encoding. Floating-point data is never interpreted or converted: NaN payloads, infinities and signed zeros survive byte-for-byte. `read_encoded_padded` plus `padded_bytes_per_row` retains the GPU copy layout for diagnostic exporters with an existing pitch receipt contract; ordinary `read_encoded` strips padding.

`BufferReadback` provides the same allocation ceiling, ordered encode, shared 30-second deadline and guaranteed unmap-on-return for opaque diagnostic buffers. Its configured byte count must be nonzero and copy-aligned; encoding copies exactly that count from source offset zero. The provider, not the SDK, interprets exposure/statistics layouts. Capture publication, metadata, float decoding and surface BGRA-to-RGBA packing remain host responsibilities.
