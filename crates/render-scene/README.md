# Pathless scene renderer

The renderer consumes `RenderScene` and explicit view/device settings. It uploads
owned meshes and textures, retains material pipeline batches, renders optional
terrain and directional shadows, and supports tightly packed RGBA offscreen
readback. It has no asset lookup or file-loading API.

Terrain uses an independently defined separable 3×3 tent filter for coverage and
a normalized material mixture. Reordering a dense palette with the matching grid
remap does not change the rendered surface. Blur radii, tints, and rotations come
from scene inputs; no content-specific blur table is embedded.

Raw-texel applications can request an empty GPU feature set. DDS block-compressed
scenes must request BC support. Invalid texture payloads return typed errors.
Opaque and alpha-masked materials, metallic-roughness lighting, exposure, and
explicit single-map directional shadows are implemented. Water, SSAO, post
processing, anti-aliasing, distance-based mesh LOD selection, and textured-sky
rendering are not implemented by this renderer; their presence in the shared
scene vocabulary is not a rendering guarantee. The desktop viewer additionally
rejects terrain and water before startup.

The tests construct procedural geometry and textures. GPU tests require a real
hardware or software adapter and fail if one cannot be acquired. For a software
Vulkan run on Linux, pass the driver selection explicitly to Cargo, for example:

```sh
VK_DRIVER_FILES=/usr/share/vulkan/icd.d/lvp_icd.json CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=2 \
  cargo test --locked -p worldrunner-render-scene -- --test-threads=1
```
